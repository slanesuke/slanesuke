### Yo! I'm Ian,

I'm passionate about becoming a developer in the Bitcoin ecosystem. I'm looking to contribute more to Bitcoin and Lightning.

I thrive at solving complex problems and building efficient, robust, and secure software. While I appreciate a well-designed front-end, my goal is to become a back-end dev.
