### Yo! I'm Ian,

I'm passionate about becoming a developer in the Bitcoin and Lightning and am looking to contribute more in the space!

I thrive at solving complex problems and building efficient, robust, and secure software. While I appreciate a well-designed front-end, my goal is to become a back-end dev.
