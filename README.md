### Yo! I'm Ian,

ðŸš€ I'm passionate about becoming a developer in the Bitcoin ecosystem. I'm looking to contribute more to Bitcoin and the Lightning Network, as well as exploring other Layer 2 solutions.

ðŸ’» I thrive at solving complex problems and building efficient, robust, and secure software. While I appreciate a well-designed front-end, my goal is to become a back-end dev.

ðŸ”§ If you're interested in Rust, or anything Bitcoin related, you're in the right place. Feel free to explore my repositories, and don't hesitate to reach out if you want to collaborate or discuss exciting projects because I'm eager to learn.


Skills: RUST / C# / JAVASCRIPT / JAVA / C++
