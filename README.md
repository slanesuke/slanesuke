### Hey, I'm Ian!

ðŸš€I'm passionate about Bitcoin and the Lightning Network, as well as exploring other Layer 2 solutions that empower the world of Bitcoin.

ðŸ’» I thrive at solving complex problems and building efficient, robust, and secure software. While I appreciate a well-designed front-end, my goal is to become a back-end engineer.

ðŸ”§ If you're interested in Rust, Bitcoin, or back-end development, you're in the right place. Feel free to explore my repositories, and don't hesitate to reach out if you want to collaborate or discuss exciting projects.
