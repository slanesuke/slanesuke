### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ian!

ðŸš€I'm passionate about Bitcoin and the Lightning Network, as well as exploring other Layer 2 solutions that empower the bitcoin ecosystem.

ðŸ’» I thrive at solving complex problems and building efficient, robust, and secure software. While I appreciate a well-designed front-end, my goal is to become a back-end engineer.

ðŸ”§ If you're interested in Rust, Bitcoin, or Lightning, you're in the right place. Feel free to explore my repositories, and don't hesitate to reach out if you want to collaborate or discuss exciting projects.


Skills: RUST / C++ / SWIFT / JAVA / C#
